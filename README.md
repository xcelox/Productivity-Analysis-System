<h1>📌 Productivity Analysis System</h1> 

This system was designed to optimize the monitoring and evaluation of operational productivity. It works as follows:

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Accesses an operational web page and uses Selenium automation to extract cargo receipt reports.✔
- **Data Consolidation**: Downloads and concatenates multiple files into a unified dataset.✔
- **Advanced Analysis**: Utilizes the Pandas library to perform complex calculations, including filtering by the IP address of operational machines.✔
- **Productivity Metrics**: Calculates productivity percentages for each operator based on hours worked versus production output.✔
- **Result Presentation**: Publishes the processed data on a dedicated web page, providing managers with a clear and interactive table of operational performance.✔

This solution ensures accurate, real-time insights into productivity, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.
